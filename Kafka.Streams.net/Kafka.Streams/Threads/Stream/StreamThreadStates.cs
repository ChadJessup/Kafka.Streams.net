     * Stream thread states are the possible states that a stream thread can be in.
     * A thread must only be in one state at a time
     * The expected state transitions with the following defined states is:
     *
     * <pre>
     *                +-------------+

     *          +<--- | Starting (2)|
     *          |     +-----+-------+
     *          |           |
     *          |           |
     *          |           v
     *          |     +-----+-------+
     *          +<--- | Partitions  |
     *          |     | Revoked (3) | <----+
     *          |     +-----+-------+      |
     *          |           |              |

     *          |           |              |
     *          |           v              |
     *          |     +-----+-------+      |
     *          |     | Running (5) | ---=>+
     *          |     +-----+-------+
     *          |           |
     *          |           v
     *          |     +-----+-------+
     *          +--=> | Pending     |
     *                | Shutdown (6)|
     *                +-----+-------+
     *                      |
     *                      v
     *                +-----+-------+
     *                | Dead (7)    |
     *                +-------------+
     * </pre>
     *
     * Note the following:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Any state can go to PENDING_SHUTDOWN. That is because streams can be closed at any time.</li>
     *     <li>
     *         State PENDING_SHUTDOWN may want to transit to some other states other than DEAD,
     *         in the corner case when the shutdown is triggered while the thread is still in the rebalance loop.
     *         In this case we will forbid the transition but will not treat as an error.
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *         State PARTITIONS_REVOKED may want transit to itself indefinitely, in the corner case when
     *         the coordinator repeatedly fails in-between revoking partitions and assigning new partitions.
     *         Also during streams instance start up PARTITIONS_REVOKED may want to transit to itself as well.
     *         In this case we will forbid the transition but will not treat as an error.
     *     </li>
     * </ul>
