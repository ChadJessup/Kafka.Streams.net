     * The window specifications used for joins.
     * <p>
     * A {@code JoinWindows} instance defines a maximum time difference for a {@link KStream#join(KStream, ValueJoiner,
     * JoinWindows) join over two streams} on the same key.
     * In SQL-style you would express this join as
     * <pre>{@code
     *     SELECT * FROM stream1, stream2
     *     WHERE
     *       stream1.key = stream2.key
     *       AND
     *       stream1.ts - before <= stream2.ts AND stream2.ts <= stream1.ts + after
     * }</pre>
     * There are three different window configuration supported:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>before = after = time-difference</li>
     *     <li>before = 0 and after = time-difference</li>
     *     <li>before = time-difference and after = 0</li>
     * </ul>
     * A join is symmetric in the sense, that a join specification on the first stream returns the same result record as
     * a join specification on the second stream with flipped before and after values.
     * <p>
     * Both values (before and after) must not result in an "inverse" window, i.e., upper-interval bound cannot be smaller
     * than lower-interval bound.
     * <p>
     * {@code JoinWindows} are sliding windows, thus, they are aligned to the actual record timestamps.
     * This implies, that each input record defines its own window with start and end time being relative to the record's
     * timestamp.
     * <p>
     * For time semantics, see {@link ITimestampExtractor}.
