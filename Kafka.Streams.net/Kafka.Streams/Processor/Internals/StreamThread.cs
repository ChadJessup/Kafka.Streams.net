         *         In this case we will forbid the transition but will not treat as an error.
         *     </li>
         *     <li>
         *         State PARTITIONS_REVOKED may want transit to itself indefinitely, in the corner case when
         *         the coordinator repeatedly fails in-between revoking partitions and assigning new partitions.
         *         Also during streams instance start up PARTITIONS_REVOKED may want to transit to itself as well.
         *         In this case we will forbid the transition but will not treat as an error.
