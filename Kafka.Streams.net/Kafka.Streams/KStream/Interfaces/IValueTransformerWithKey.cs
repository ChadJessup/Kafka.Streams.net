     * record of a stream and can access and modify a state that is available beyond a single call of
     * {@link #transform(object, object)} (cf. {@link ValueMapper} for stateless value transformation).
     * Additionally, this {@code ValueTransformerWithKey} can
     * {@link IProcessorContext#schedule(Duration, PunctuationType, Punctuator) schedule} a method to be
     * {@link Punctuator#punctuate(long) called periodically} with the provided context.
     * Note that the key is read-only and should not be modified, as this can lead to corrupt partitioning.
     * If {@code ValueTransformerWithKey} is applied to a {@link KeyValue} pair record the record's key is preserved.
     * <p>
     * Use {@link ValueTransformerWithKeySupplier} to provide new instances of {@link ValueTransformerWithKey} to
     * Kafka Stream's runtime.
