         * By default all Streams operators emit results whenever new results are available.

         *
         * This configuration will instead emit just one result per key for each window, guaranteeing

         * requires a hard guarantee that only the  result is propagated. For example, sending alerts.
         *
         * To accomplish this, the operator will buffer events from the window until the window close (that is,
         * until the end-time passes, and.Additionally until the grace period expires). Since windowed operators
         * are required to reject late events for a window whose grace period is expired, there is an.Additional
         * guarantee that the  results emitted from this suppression will match any queriable state upstream.

         *                     This is required to be a "strict" config, since it would violate the " results"
         *                     property to emit early and then issue an update later.
