     * record of a stream and can access and modify a state that is available beyond a single call of
     * {@link #transform(object)} (cf. {@link ValueMapper} for stateless value transformation).
     * Additionally, this {@code ValueTransformer} can {@link IProcessorContext#schedule(Duration, PunctuationType, Punctuator) schedule}
     * a method to be {@link Punctuator#punctuate(long) called periodically} with the provided context.
     * If {@code ValueTransformer} is applied to a {@link KeyValue} pair record the record's key is preserved.
     * <p>
     * Use {@link ValueTransformerSupplier} to provide new instances of {@code ValueTransformer} to Kafka Stream's runtime.

     * If a record's key and value should be modified {@link Transformer} can be used.
