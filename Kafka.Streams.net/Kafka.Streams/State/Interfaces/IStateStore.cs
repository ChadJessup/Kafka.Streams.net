     * A storage engine for managing state maintained by a stream processor.
     * <p>
     * If the store is implemented as a persistent store, it <em>must</em> use the store name as directory name and write
     * all data into this store directory.
     * The store directory must be created with the state directory.
     * The state directory can be obtained via {@link IProcessorContext#stateDir() #stateDir()} using the
     * {@link IProcessorContext} provided via {@link #init(IProcessorContext, IStateStore) init(...)}.
     * <p>
     * Using nested store directories within the state directory isolates different state stores.
     * If a state store would write into the state directory directly, it might conflict with others state stores and thus,
     * data might get corrupted and/or Streams might fail with an error.
     * Furthermore, Kafka Streams relies on using the store name as store directory name to perform internal cleanup tasks.
     * <p>
     * This interface does not specify any query capabilities, which, of course,
     * would be query engine specific. Instead it just specifies the minimum
     * functionality required to reload a storage engine from its changelog as well
     * as basic lifecycle management.
