     * to perform the assignment and the results are forwarded back to each respective members

     * assignment decisions. For this, you can override {@link #subscriptionUserData(Set)} and provide custom
     * userData in the returned Subscription. For example, to have a rack-aware assignor, an implementation
     * can use this user data to forward the rackId belonging to each member.
