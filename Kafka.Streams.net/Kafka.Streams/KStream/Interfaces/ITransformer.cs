     * This is a stateful record-by-record operation, i.e, {@link #transform(object, object)} is invoked individually for
     * each record of a stream and can access and modify a state that is available beyond a single call of
     * {@link #transform(object, object)} (cf. {@link KeyValueMapper} for stateless record transformation).
     * Additionally, this {@code Transformer} can {@link IProcessorContext#schedule(Duration, PunctuationType, Punctuator) schedule}
     * a method to be {@link Punctuator#punctuate(long) called periodically} with the provided context.
     * <p>
     * Use {@link TransformerSupplier} to provide new instances of {@code Transformer} to Kafka Stream's runtime.
     * <p>
     * If only a record's value should be modified {@link ValueTransformer} can be used.
